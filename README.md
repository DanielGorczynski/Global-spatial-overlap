# Description of all code and data files included in the repository
# Code
Global FD Code ProcB.R - All code used in the manuscript, including calculation of functional diversity metrics, Bayesian regressions, and figures
# Data
All TEAM Occupancy.csv- Data frame containing median occupancy estimates for all species monitored at TEAM sites over the years that surveys were conducted at each site. Formatted for use in Global FD Code ProcB.R
Full trait list bi 1 kg.csv- Data frame containing all trait data of all species found in communities or species pools of the TEAM sites. Body mass and litter size are continous variables, diet and activity period are categorical binary variables, and social group and substrate use are binary. Formatted for use in Global FD Code ProcB.R
Species1.csv- Data frame listing the species pools of each of the TEAM sites. Formatted for use in Global FD Code ProcB.R
TEAM Site Funct bi.csv- Data frame containing site level variables for use in the Bayesian regression component of the analysis. The data frame includes the different functional diversity response variables and the historical, environmental and anthropogenic predictor variables.
